Problems from m-file: 
1.Error-> OS4dynamics_plot_01(line21)
plot(os4sim_time.data,os4sim_stateR.data(:,1),'r'); hold on
2. Run OS4dynamics_01_init
   Run OS4dynamics_animation_01
   Shows Error
	Undefined variable "os4sim_time" or class "os4sim_time.data".

	Error in OS4dynamics_animation_01 (line 159)
	for i=2:size(os4sim_time.data)
   Shows Warning
   	No video frames were written to this file. The file may be invalid.

  Show Figure, 
  But there is a video with some millsecond and create a avi file named os4sim_animation
  It feels like the video is not playing right, but wondering why.


3. run OS4dynamics_animation_01 only
Error->
Undefined variable "OS4_physical" or class "OS4_physical.size.fuselage.x".

Error in OS4dynamics_animation_01 (line 26)
    X_fl = [OS4_physical.size.fuselage.x/2 , OS4_physical.size.fuselage.x/2 ,
    -OS4_physical.size.fuselage.x/2 , -OS4_physical.size.fuselage.x/2
    OS4_physical.size.fuselage.x/2];
something shows up but emty
